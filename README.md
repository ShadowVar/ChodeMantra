# ChodeMantra

**ChodeMantra** is a desktop application designed to automate code snippet typing with human-like behavior, simulating natural typing patterns for educational purposes. Built with **Electron** for a cross-platform interface and **Python** for typing automation, it enables users to save and trigger up to three code snippets using global keyboard shortcuts. This tool is ideal for studying automation techniques in environments like browser-based coding platforms (e.g., CodeTantra, confirmed functional as of June 18, 2025‚Äîverify compatibility at [www.codetantra.com](https://www.codetantra.com)).

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer**: ChodeMantra is intended for **educational use only** to explore typing automation. Unauthorized use in proctored exams or restricted environments may violate academic integrity policies or terms of service. Always use responsibly and ethically.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Human-Like Typing**  
  Simulates typing at ~65 WPM with randomized delays, typos, and corrections to mimic natural behavior.

- **Global Shortcuts**  
  Trigger snippets with `Ctrl+Alt+Q`, `Ctrl+Alt+W`, or `Ctrl+Alt+E`. Playful error messages are typed for incorrect shortcuts (`Ctrl+Alt+Z/X/C/V/B/N`).

- **Snippet Management**  
  Store and manage up to three code snippets via an intuitive Electron-based UI.

- **Indentation Handling**  
  Automatically removes leading/trailing whitespace from snippets to prevent conflicts with coding editors‚Äô auto-indentation. Manual indentation fixes may be required (future updates will address this).

- **Logging**  
  Tracks actions in `logs/snippet_log.txt` for easy debugging and usage monitoring.

- **Browser-Based Proctoring Compatibility**  
  Optimized for browser-based platforms (e.g., CodeTantra), where hardware keyboard detection is less likely compared to standalone proctoring apps.

### üß† Human-Like Typing Features

ChodeMantra replicates natural typing patterns to create a realistic simulation, perfect for studying automation in controlled settings:

- **Variable Typing Speed**  
  Uses `random.triangular()` to vary character typing speed, reflecting human rhythm.

- **Context-Sensitive Delays**  
  - **Punctuation** (e.g., `.`, `;`): Slower to mimic careful key presses.  
  - **Whitespace**: Faster, as humans quickly press spaces.  
  - **Uppercase Letters**: Slower to simulate Shift-key delays.

- **Simulated Typos & Corrections**  
  Randomly inserts typos (1/20 chance) and corrects them with backspaces, mimicking human error correction.

- **Hesitation & Fatigue Pauses**  
  Adds random pauses every 24‚Äì36 characters to simulate mental breaks or fatigue.

- **Word-Level Thinking Pauses**  
  Inserts 0.6‚Äì1.7s pauses after 6‚Äì12 words to mimic sentence construction.

- **Line Break Simulation**  
  Triggers Enter key with randomized delays for natural line transitions.

- **Randomized Timing**  
  All delays (characters, typos, pauses) are randomized within human-like ranges to avoid detection by anti-bot systems.

- **Pre-Typing Delay**  
  Includes a 3-second delay before typing to allow window switching, simulating user preparation.

## üöÄ Usage in Browser-Based Proctored Tests

ChodeMantra is tailored for browser-based coding platforms like CodeTantra (functional as of June 18, 2025‚Äîverify at [www.codetantra.com](https://www.codetantra.com)). Below is a step-by-step guide for using it to study automation techniques in such environments.

> **‚ö†Ô∏è Note**: This workflow is for educational exploration. Using automation in proctored exams may violate rules and lead to consequences. Always adhere to ethical guidelines.

### Workflow
1. **Open the Test**  
   Launch the proctored test in a supported browser (e.g., Chrome, Edge, Brave).

2. **Enable Browser Utilities**  
   Install Chrome extensions to bypass restrictions:  
   - **Enable Right Click & Copy**: [Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/ofgdcdohlhjfdhbnfkikfeakhpojhpgm?utm_source=item-share-cb)  
   - **Always Active Window**: [Link](https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/always-active-window-alwa/ehllkhjndgnlokhomdlhgbineffifcbj)  
   Ensure extensions are active during the test.

3. **Run ChodeMantra**  
   Start ChodeMantra via `npm start` or the executable before the test. Keep it running in the background.

4. **Extract Test Questions**  
   Use a text extractor like **Microsoft PowerToys Text Extractor** ([Download](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/)) to capture question text if copying is disabled.

5. **Generate Code Solutions**  
   Paste the question into an AI LLM (e.g., ChatGPT Desktop App, [Download](https://openai.com/chatgpt/download)) to generate code solutions.

6. **Prepare Snippets in ChodeMantra**  
   - Copy the generated code.  
   - Paste into ChodeMantra‚Äôs tabs (Chode 1, Chode 2, Chode 3).  
   - Click **üíæ Save & Start** to register shortcuts.  
   - **Note**: Whitespace is automatically trimmed to avoid auto-indentation issues. Manual fixes may be needed post-typing.

7. **Type Snippets**  
   - Switch to the test‚Äôs code editor within 3 seconds.  
   - Use shortcuts:  
     - `Ctrl+Alt+Q`: Types Chode 1 snippet.  
     - `Ctrl+Alt+W`: Types Chode 2 snippet.  
     - `Ctrl+Alt+E`: Types Chode 3 snippet.  
   - Code is typed with human-like behavior.

8. **Work Efficiently**  
   Minimize window switching to avoid proctoring flags or auto-submission. Practice in a mock environment for speed.

9. **Verify Output**  
   - Check typed code for indentation errors and fix manually if needed.  
   - Review `logs/snippet_log.txt` for usage details.

### Why Browser-Based Tests?
- Browser-based platforms are less likely to detect non-hardware keyboard input.  
- Standalone proctoring apps may terminate background processes, affecting ChodeMantra.  
- Always test compatibility with your specific platform.
